## Goals
My current goal is to learn about stock price data and gaussian processes. Thus, I decided to try and fit microsoft stock data using gaussian processes. At least, this was the original idea, as this won't work the way I thought it would (cf. [Analyses](#analyses)). I may decide to stick to the  <a href="/DataSets/Docs/Datasets.md">MSFT dataset</a> but switch to other methods. The goal is not to implement a competetice GP library. I am aware that there are existing implementations that are much better than my take (e.g. 2. in [References](#references)).

## What are Gaussian Processes?

The theroretical answer would be: A probability distribution over function spaces. My anwer would be: A tool to fit training data and predict for test data just using the assumed or estimated convariance structure of the data.

I won't go into any more detail as there is great source material available. Check out [1.](#references) and [3.](#references) in references.

## Implementation
The gp implementation [gaussian_process.py](../gaussian_process.py) is homebrew. The implementation is mostly based on [1.](#references) (lectures 9 and 12 if aI remember correctly). The rest is currently pretty much plot-tools and data-plumbing using pandas. 

## Usage
I haven't managed to write a command line parser yet. There is an
