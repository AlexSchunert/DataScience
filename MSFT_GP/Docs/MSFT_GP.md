# MSFT vs GP

## Goals
My current goal is to learn about stock price data and gaussian processes. Thus, I decided to try and fit Microsoft stock data using gaussian processes. At least, this was the original idea, as this won't work the way I thought it would (cf. [Analyses](#analyses)). I may decide to stick to the  <a href="/DataSets/Docs/Datasets.md">MSFT dataset</a> but switch to other methods. The goal is not to implement a competitive GP library. There are much better options out there (e.g. [2. in References](#references)).

## What are Gaussian Processes?
The textbook answer may be something like "A probability distribution over function spaces". In this repo I used it as a tool to fit training data and test the predictions against test data just using the assumed or estimated covariance structure of the data.

I won't go into any more detail as there is great source material available. Check out [1.](#references) and [3.](#references) in references.

## Implementation
The gp implementation [gaussian_process.py](../gaussian_process.py) is homebrew. It is mostly based on [1.](#references) (lectures 9 and 12 if I remember correctly). The rest is currently pretty much plot-tools and data-plumbing using pandas. 

## Usage
In this folder:
`python -m main [-h] [--mode MODE]`
